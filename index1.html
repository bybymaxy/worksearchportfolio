                    meet new people. I love being outdoors camping, backpacking, hiking, playing sports, and
                    walking my
                    2
                    big dogs ranger and Maxy. I have mainly done construction jobs and working in logistics and
                    decided
                    to
                    go into coding to try to make a life change into something that will help me live a longer and
                    healthier
                    lifestyle with my partner Paige.</p>

                    <P>Maxy is my second doggy! I love him just as much as his daddy but he is hard headed here is a
                        cute picture of him looking misrable because he refused to use his doghouse when we had to leave
                        for work.</P>

                <li><img src="./assets/backpackranger.png" alt="backpackingranger">
                    <p> This is ranger he is the first dog i ever owned as an adult. He is a wolf hybrid so he can be a
                        little crazy and loves getting into the trash and stealing your food. He is a good boy though
                        and loves being off leash when we go backpacking in the forest or mountains. He really loves
                        cold climates and will sleep in the snow and beg to be outside when its raining.</p>

                    <p>And Last but not least the last of the pets. Mushu is a 13 year old maincoon mix. I love him to
                        death! He follows me around much like a dog and if i were a super hero he would be my sidekick.
